# API-Challenge
Code is up. WeatherPy is 100%. I was able to generate all code and I believe it's working.
All images are output in the Images folder.
Conclusions are in the final cell of the WeatherPy Jupyter Notebook.

As for VacationPy. Most of the code is complete.
I could not get the code to work for finding a hotel within 5000 meters of the cities with the defined weather parameters. The rest of the code worked.
I ran out of time.
Submitted as is.
Mea Culpa Mea Culpa.
